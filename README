Project: EcoDynamo-UX

This project translate to Linux the Windows application EcoDynamo.
It is a C++ application, developed with Borland C++ 6 compiler in Windows
and with Gnu C++ 4.8.1 in Linux.

The structure of the source code in Linux is:

base_dir
 |
 |- EcoDynamo-UX    (main program to start simulation)
 |  |- main.cpp
 |
 |- DLLs
 |  |- BacterObjt   (src code for Bacteria shared library)
 |  |- DissObjt     (src code for Dissolved shared library)
 |  |- ECDProtocol  (src code for ECDP shared library)
 |  |- EcoClass     (src code for EcoClass shared library)
 |  |- EcoDynamo    (src code for EcoDynamo shared library)
 |  |- FishObjt     (src code for Fish shared library)
 |  |- FlowObjt     (src code for Flow shared library)
 |  |- HydrObjt     (src code for Hydro shared library)
 |  |- IceAlgaeObjt (src code for IceAlgae shared library)
 |  |- IceObjt      (src code for Ice shared library)
 |  |- include      (generic header files)
 |  |- Iodll        (src code for IO shared library)
 |  |- LiteObjt     (src code for Light shared library)
 |  |- MacrObjt     (src code for Macrophytes shared library)
 |  |- ManObjt      (src code for Man shared library)
 |  |- OutputResults  (src code for OutRes shared library)
 |  |- params       (src code for Parms shared library)
 |  |- PhytObjt     (src code for Phyto shared library)
 |  |- PredatorObjt (src code for Predator shared library)
 |  |- PreyObjt     (src code for Prey shared library)
 |  |- Sediments    (src code for Sediments shared library)
 |  |- SpmObjt      (src code for SuspMatter shared library)
 |  |- TAirObjt     (src code for TAir shared library)
 |  |- Tidedll      (src code for Tides shared library)
 |  |- TideObjt     (src code for EcoDynTide shared library)
 |  |- TWatObjt     (src code for TWater shared library)
 |  |- Utilities    (src code for Utilities shared library)
 |  |- WindObjt     (src code for Wind shared library)
 |  |- ZoobObjt     (src code for SuspFeeders shared library)
 |  |- ZoopObjt     (src code for Zooplankton shared library)
 |
 |- Models
 |  |- MIZ0         (example of a 0D model)
 |

Each source directory has its own project file (CMakeLists.txt), 
one project is defined for shared libraries (DLLs), 
and one another for complete EcoDynamo-UX executable.

The generated binary code for executable and shared libraries is located in
folders with the structure:

home_dir
 |
 |- bin     (executable)
 |  |- lib  (shared libraries)
 |

The results could be saved in HDF format files, so HDF5 and zlib libraries 
must be installed in the system. 
It is assumed that the binary code for libraries is installed in /usr/local/bin
and include files are located in /usr/include.
